%% This is a sample manuscript marked up using the
%% AASTeX v5.x LaTeX 2e macros.

%% The first piece of markup in an AASTeX v5.x document
%% is the \documentclass command. LaTeX will ignore
%% any data that comes before this command.

%% The command below calls the preprint style
%% which will produce a one-column, single-spaced document.
%% Examples of commands for other substyles follow. Use
%% whichever is most appropriate for your purposes.
%%
%%\documentclass[12pt,preprint]{aastex}

%% manuscript produces a one-column, double-spaced document:

\documentclass[manuscript]{aastex}

%% preprint2 produces a double-column, single-spaced document:

%% \documentclass[preprint2]{aastex}

%% Sometimes a paper's abstract is too long to fit on the
%% title page in preprint2 mode. When that is the case,
%% use the longabstract style option.

%% \documentclass[preprint2,longabstract]{aastex}

%% If you want to create your own macros, you can do so
%% using \newcommand. Your macros should appear before
%% the \begin{document} command.
%%
%% If you are submitting to a journal that translates manuscripts
%% into SGML, you need to follow certain guidelines when preparing
%% your macros. See the AASTeX v5.x Author Guide
%% for information.

\newcommand{\vdag}{(v)^\dagger}
\newcommand{\myemail}{skywalker@galaxy.far.far.away}

\newcommand{\TODO}[1]{\textbf{TODO #1}}

%% You can insert a short comment on the title page using the command below.

\slugcomment{Not to appear in Nonlearned J., 45.}

%% If you wish, you may supply running head information, although
%% this information may be modified by the editorial offices.
%% The left head contains a list of authors,
%% usually a maximum of three (otherwise use et al.).  The right
%% head is a modified title of up to roughly 44 characters.
%% Running heads will not print in the manuscript style.

\shorttitle{Collapsed Cores in Globular Clusters}
\shortauthors{Djorgovski et al.}

%% This is the end of the preamble.  Indicate the beginning of the
%% paper itself with \begin{document}.

\begin{document}

%% LaTeX will automatically break titles if they run longer than
%% one line. However, you may use \\ to force a line break if
%% you desire.

\title{The Oddity}

%% Use \author, \affil, and the \and command to format
%% author and affiliation information.
%% Note that \email has replaced the old \authoremail command
%% from AASTeX v4.0. You can use \email to mark an email address
%% anywhere in the paper, not just in the front matter.
%% As in the title, use \\ to force line breaks.

%% Notice that each of these authors has alternate affiliations, which
%% are identified by the \altaffilmark after each name.  Specify alternate
%% affiliation information with \altaffiltext, with one command per each
%% affiliation.

%% Mark off your abstract in the ``abstract'' environment. In the manuscript
%% style, abstract will output a Received/Accepted line after the
%% title and affiliation information. No date will appear since the author
%% does not have this information. The dates will be filled in by the
%% editorial office after submission.

\begin{abstract}

  TODO ABSTRACT GOES HERE.

\end{abstract}

%% Keywords should appear after the \end{abstract} command. The uncommented
%% example has been keyed in ApJ style. See the instructions to authors
%% for the journal to which you are submitting your paper to determine
%% what keyword punctuation is appropriate.

\keywords{TODO WRITE SOME KEYWORDS}

%% From the front matter, we move on to the body of the paper.
%% In the first two sections, notice the use of the natbib \citep
%% and \citet commands to identify citations.  The citations are
%% tied to the reference list via symbolic KEYs. The KEY corresponds
%% to the KEY in the \bibitem in the reference list below. We have
%% chosen the first three characters of the first author's name plus
%% the last two numeral of the year of publication as our KEY for
%% each reference.


%% Authors who wish to have the most important objects in their paper
%% linked in the electronic edition to a data center may do so by tagging
%% their objects with \objectname{} or \object{}.  Each macro takes the
%% object name as its required argument. The optional, square-bracket 
%% argument should be used in cases where the data center identification
%% differs from what is to be printed in the paper.  The text appearing 
%% in curly braces is what will appear in print in the published paper. 
%% If the object name is recognized by the data centers, it will be linked
%% in the electronic edition to the object data available at the data centers  
%%
%% Note that for sources with brackets in their names, e.g. [WEG2004] 14h-090,
%% the brackets must be escaped with backslashes when used in the first
%% square-bracket argument, for instance, \object[\[WEG2004\] 14h-090]{90}).
%%  Otherwise, LaTeX will issue an error. 

\section{Introduction}

TODO INTRODUCTION GOES HERE.

\section{Experiments}

This section presents four experiments to demonstrate and analyse Oddity. For familiarity, SDSS images will be used as the dataset for the experiments. \TODO{talk about the relevant details of the images, position, resolution etc.}. SDSS data is an appropriate test for Oddity because background pixels are nearly iid at resolutions above \TODO{??}.

Unless otherwise specified, the same parameter settings are used across all experiments. These are the default settings provided with the released version of Oddity, except that a maximum box size of 16 pixels has been set. This means no boxes larger than $16\times16$ pixels are considered when performing the Gibbs sampling stage. The SDSS images have a variation in the background distribution statistically visible at scales above $16 \times 16$ pixels, and setting this maximum box size prevents large false detections from occuring.

It is worth noting that, other than the maximum box size, the parameters were chosen before testing on the SDSS data began. This indicates that careful configuration is unecessary, though it could well result in better performance.

\subsection{Detection of inserted sources}

First, we insert some constructed sources into SDSS images and attempt to detect them with Oddity. These sources are of the kind we are interested in detecting: dim and extended. 

\TODO{description of how they are made.}

\subsection{Comparison with SDSS catalogue}

Next, we will compare the catalogue generated by Oddity with SDSS's own source extraction software. Specifically we are interested in the types of sources that one approach detects, but not the other. The data used for this experiment is \TODO{some arbitrary field I downloaded.}

\TODO{I need to do this.}

\subsection{Analysis of the detection limit}

\TODO{intro}

This is intended as a general indication of the faintest sources that can be detected and ignores more complex properties of sources. Results on real sources will differ somewhat.


\subsection{Analysis of consistency of results}

Oddity is a stochastic algorithm and is unlikely to ever return the exact same set of boxes after any two runs. Due to this one might think that its results are inconsistent and a single run should not be trusted. These final results demonstrate that Oddity's results are in fact very consistent, and a source detected in one run will be detected in almost all runs.
